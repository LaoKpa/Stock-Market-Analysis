    "## Modern Portfolio Theory\n",
    "In this module, Weâ€™ll be looking at investment portfolio optimization with python, the fundamental concept of diversification and the creation of an efficient frontier that can be used by investors to choose specific mixes of assets based on investment goals; that is, the trade off between their desired level of portfolio return vs their desired level of portfolio risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Modern Portfolio Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp) suggests that it is possible to construct an \"efficient frontier\" of optimal portfolios, offering the maximum possible expected return for a given level of risk. It suggests that it is not enough to look at the expected risk and return of one particular stock. By investing in more than one stock, an investor can reap the benefits of diversification, particularly a reduction in the riskiness of the portfolio. MPT quantifies the benefits of diversification, also known as not putting all of your eggs in one basket.\n",
